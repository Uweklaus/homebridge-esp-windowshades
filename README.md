# Homebridge ESP Window Shades

Homebridge plugin for controlling ESP8266-based motorized wireless window shade.
This is expanded for more than one shade controlled by one ESP8266.

# Why

Controlling your  window shade through Siri is be actually quite cool. I will publish also the software for controlling more than one shade later.
